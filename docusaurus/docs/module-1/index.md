# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

**Subtitle**: ROS 2 - The Robot Operating System

## Overview

Just as the human nervous system coordinates all bodily functions through a network of neurons and signals, ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the communication backbone that enables all components of a humanoid robot to work together seamlessly.

In this module, you will learn how ROS 2 provides the fundamental infrastructure for building robust, scalable robot systems. We cover the core concepts that every robotics engineer needs to understand before moving on to simulation and advanced AI integration.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How ROS 2 differs from traditional software systems
- The communication patterns that enable robot coordination
- How to structure Python-based robot control systems
- The anatomy of a humanoid robot in software terms
- How AI agents integrate with robot control systems
