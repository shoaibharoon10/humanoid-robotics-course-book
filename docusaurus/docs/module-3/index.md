# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain

**Subtitle**: NVIDIA Isaac Platform

## Overview

Modern humanoid robots require sophisticated AI capabilities to perceive their environment, navigate complex spaces, and interact intelligently with the world around them. NVIDIA's Isaac platform provides the computational foundation and tools for building these intelligent robot systems.

In this module, you will learn how Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS work together to enable advanced perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities for humanoid robots.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The architecture and capabilities of Isaac Sim
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) fundamentals
- Navigation and path planning for humanoid robots
- GPU-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Synthetic data generation for training perception models

## Prerequisites

:::info Before You Begin
This module builds upon concepts from **[Module 2: The Digital Twin](../module-2)**. You should understand:

- Digital twin concepts and simulation fundamentals
- Gazebo simulation environment basics
- Sensor simulation principles
- Physics engine behavior

Additionally, familiarity with **[Module 1](../module-1)** ROS 2 concepts is essential.
