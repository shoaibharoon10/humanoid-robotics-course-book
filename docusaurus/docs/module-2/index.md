# Module 2: The Digital Twin

**Subtitle**: Gazebo & Unity

## Overview

Before deploying code to a physical humanoid robot, we need a safe environment to test and validate our algorithms. Digital twins provide this capability by creating high-fidelity virtual representations of physical robots and their environments.

In this module, you will explore two complementary simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-accurate robot simulation and Unity for photorealistic visualization and human-robot interaction scenarios.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The concept and value of digital twins in robotics
- Fundamentals of physics simulation for robot behavior
- How Gazebo enables accurate robot control validation
- Unity's role in visualization and HRI development
- Techniques for simulating robot sensors

## Prerequisites

:::info Before You Begin
This module builds upon concepts from **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System](../module-1)**. You should understand:

- ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Basic robot control concepts
- URDF robot descriptions
